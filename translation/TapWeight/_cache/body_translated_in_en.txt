<h3 id="注意"> Caution</h3>

<h3 id="背景"> Background</h3>
<p> People frequently measure their weight and body fat percentage on a daily basis using a scale. Many iPhone users register their weight and body fat data on the "Health Care" application.</p>
<p> The best solution is to use a smart scale that works with the Health Care app and automatically stores measurements, but they can be expensive and inaccessible. Manual data registration is possible in the "Health Care" app, but unfortunately, the "Health Care" app is not designed for daily manual registration of measurements. Therefore, manually entering data that occurs continuously on a daily basis, such as weight measurements, can be a very time-consuming and stressful experience.</p>
<p> We developed this app to solve such problems.</p>
